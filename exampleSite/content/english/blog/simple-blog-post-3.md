TimeZero is a multiplayer browser-based online game. It is a shareware project with the purchase of a special game currency - gold coins.

The world of TimeZero is a planet that has survived a terrifying disaster. Nuclear war devastated blooming lands and virtually destroyed civilization. The increased level of radiation caused a huge number of mutations, which is why mutants appeared in the world. In the world of the game, only the settlement New Moscow is sufficiently protected from attacks and radiation. A player can fight both mutants and other players.

The game world of TimeZero consists of 128,881 locations. Initially, the atmosphere was rather close to Fallout. TimeZero also has a number of significant differences.

Among them: our own battle system, a wide selection of the same type of weapons and armor, 14 game professions (including 3 subprofessionals) and various quests. There are also 12 types of monsters and 2 factions that are at war with each other.

Each TimeZero character can receive one of 14 professions: corsair, prospector, mercenary, stalker, journalist, trader, patrol, attack aircraft, specialist, engineer, psionic, dealer, convict, polymorph. To get a certain profession, you need to complete a specific quest (task). However, to get a profession like a convict, you must have your character convicted and sentenced to hard labor. And in order to get the profession of patrol, specialist or attack aircraft, you must be a member of the Police clan. The psionic profession has 3 sub-professions: psi-kinetic, psi-leader and psi-medium.

The game constantly has to fight monsters. Currently, the bestiary has 13 of the following creatures: witch jelly, Whack, rat mutant, dingo, stich, mantis, worm, ergo, mechanoid, scorpion, obsessed, arachnid, antis.
