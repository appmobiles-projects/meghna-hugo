Carousel is a Russian federal state international television channel for children and youth. It broadcasts around the clock from Moscow, from the Ostankino television center throughout Russia and in many countries of the world. It is the largest Russian television channel in terms of coverage.

A joint project of Channel One and the All-Russian State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company. It began broadcasting on December 27, 2010 at 5:00 by showing the program “Jump-Skok Team”. It is positioned as the main Russian children's channel in the world. It was one of two federal television channels (along with the Culture channel; before the launch of OTR), which broadcast without ads (since 2011, sponsorship videos). In 2014, an advertisement appeared on the channel. Initially, various products for children were presented among the commercials, but due to the involvement of a female audience over 40 years old (based on the results of television measurements), an advertisement for food and medicine appeared. The age of the target audience is from 3 to 14 years. The broadcasting concept and broadcast formats are developed with the participation of child psychologists and educators. VGTRK and Channel One are involved in the production of programs, as well as third-party manufacturers (ATV, VayT Media, M-production, ARS, ACC-TV). The basis of the broadcast (about 60%) is cognitive and entertaining programs of their production, the rest is Russian and foreign art and animation films. On December 30, 2019, the logo and design with screensavers on the Carousel TV channel were changed.
