Representative site on which all sections of the ORT channel are briefly presented in separate sections. The user can familiarize themselves with each and choose the right one for himself and his family.

For a more visual representation of each direction, the following are used: text description text of CEO addressing the audience graphic presentation in the form of logos of photographs of stars, selected graphics according to the meaning of the image providing accompanying videos in each direction. All this is realized thanks to the development of flash applications for ORT.
The site consists of: information block, main menu, submenu for each section.
A two-level menu located on the right and left sides of the information block is used as a navigation menu. On the first level are the main areas, on the second sections of these areas. In addition, a submenu is used for each section. This allows the user to more conveniently perceive various types of information. To switch between subsections, scrolling of the information screen is used.

Target audience - Internet users outside the Russian Federation. Initially, the site was created for desktop computers, but now, with the trends of the time, it is adapted for viewing on mobile devices.
